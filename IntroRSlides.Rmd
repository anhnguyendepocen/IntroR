## Today's workshop

R Learning objectives:

- read in and manipulate basic data
- basic statistics
- some graphing

My goal is to teach you how to do basic data analysis in R and get you comfortable enough to help yourself go further with R.


## Introducing R

- R is a language and environment for statistical computing and graphics
- Freely available and maintained by volunteers
- R is extensible; can be expanded by installing "packages" or by creating your own "functions"
- Frequently used with RStudio, a free IDE (Interactive Development Environment) for R


## How to get R and RStudio

**R**: http://cran.r-project.org/ (or better yet, Google “Download R”)

**RStudio**: http://www.rstudio.com/ 

Both are available for Windows, Mac, and Linux and free to install (no catches).

If you install R and RStudio, then you only need to run RStudio.


## Using R

- command-line driven (*very* little point-and-click)
- use "functions" to work with data
- can work interactively (one function at a time) or write a script to submit multiple functions at once
- requires time and effort to learn, but RStudio makes the process easier


## R basics - functions

R uses *functions* to perform operations.

Functions take *arguments* to specify how operations are performed.

Example: `read.csv(file="scores.csv")`

`read.csv` is a function to import a CSV file; `file` is an argument.

R has **many** functions. Fortunately about 20% of them do about 80% of the work.

## R basics - assignment

We often need to save a function's result or output. For this we use the assignment operator: ` <- `

For example, when you import a CSV file you need to give it a name:

`scoreData <- read.csv(file="scores.csv")`

Now we can use `scoreData` as an argument to other functions. For example: `summary(scoreData)` which computes summaries for each column in the data.

**Note**: Use `Alt + -` in RStudio to quickly insert ` <- `. You can also use `=` for assignment.

## R basics - objects

R creates and manipulates *objects*. Examples of objects are vectors, data frames, matrices and lists. You can create as many objects as memory allows.

```{r}
# create vector of character strings
gender <- c("Male","Female","Male") 

# create vector of numbers
x <- seq(0, 10, by=2) 

# create data frame
forbes <- read.csv("Forbes2000.csv")  

# perform a t-test and save results in a list
tout <- t.test(extra ~ group, data = sleep)
```


## R basics - packages

All functions belong to *packages*. R comes with about 30 packages, but as of August 2015, there are *over 7000* user-contributed packages!

To use functions in a package, the package must be installed and loaded. 

You only install a package once. You load a package whenever you want to use its functions.

Examples of packages that come with R:

- The `stats` package contains statistical functions
- The `foreign` package contains functions for reading data from other statistical programs
- The `graphics` package contains functions for creating graphics


## R in a Nutshell

**Use functions in various packages to create and manipulate objects**.

So we need to learn...

- some useful functions
- how to install and load packages
- about different R objects
- how to use RStudio
- how to get help

Let's open up RStudio and get started!

## A selection of R Commands

## Helpful RStudio keyboard shortcuts

- `Ctrl + Enter` to submit code
- `Tab` key to let RStudio finish typing commands for you
- `Shift + down arrow` to highlight lines or blocks of code
- `Ctrl + 1` and `Ctrl + 2` to switch between script and console
- up and down arrows cycle through previous commands in console
- `Ctrl + Shift + C` to comment/uncomment a block of lines
- `Ctrl + L` to clear the console
